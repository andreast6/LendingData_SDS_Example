The interest rate (int_rate) of 10.94% is reasonable for a loan issued in Nov-2015, considering the borrower's risk profile, including a debt-to-income ratio (dti) of 11.09 and a long credit history (earliest_cr_line in Oct-2003). The installment amount is correctly calculated based on the loan amount, term, and interest rate. The borrower's employment status, income, and home ownership also seem plausible. However, a perfect score is not given due to the lack of information on how the data was synthesized and potential minor inconsistencies that could be present but are not immediately apparent.\"\n",
